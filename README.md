# COS341-Practicals
# Compiler Construction Practicals

This repository contains practical assignments for the Compiler Construction course. Each practical focuses on a specific aspect of compiler design and implementation.

## Prerequisites
To work on these practicals, you should have a basic understanding of programming languages and data structures.

## Contents
1. Practical 1: Introduction to Lexical Analysis
   - Implement a basic lexer to tokenize input source code.

2. Practical 2: Lexer and Parser
   - Build a lexer to tokenize input source code.
   - Develop a parser to recognize the syntactic structure of the input code.

3. Practical 3: Scoping Rules
   - Understand and implement scoping rules in a compiler.
   - Handle variable scoping and symbol table management.

4. Practical 4: Optimization Techniques
   - Explore various optimization techniques to improve the performance of the generated code.

5. Practical 5: Translation
   - Study the process of translating source code into executable machine code.
   - Implement a translation phase to generate intermediate code.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions provided in each practical's directory to complete the assigned tasks. Make sure to read the accompanying documentation and code comments for guidance.
